      <h2>I&apos;m Tharun Goud,</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Frontend Developer, specialized in building clean, responsive
        interfaces using Next JS, React JS, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. My
        experience includes translating UI/UX designs into functional code and
        optimizing web performance for seamless user experience. With the
        knowledge of Next JS and Remix, i can collaborate effectively on
        full-stack projects, bridging the gap between frontend and backend
        development. I also bring an understanding of project workflows, making
        it easier to align development with team goals and deadlines.
